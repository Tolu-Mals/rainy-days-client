# Savings App built with Reactjs

I worked with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management, and Material UI with styled components for styling.

The web app is not complete, however the authentication flow is complete and working. Parts of the dashboard layout are complete as well.

Every part of the UI is responsive and looks good on mobile.
